# Flappy Bird Clone

This is a simple Flappy Bird clone implemented in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework. The game features a bird that the player can control to navigate through pipes while avoiding collisions.

## Features

- **Gravity and Jump Mechanics**: The bird falls due to gravity and can jump when the space key is pressed.
- **Pipes**: Randomly generated pipes that the bird must navigate through.
- **Score Tracking**: The score increases each time the bird successfully passes through a pipe.
- **Game Over State**: The game ends when the bird collides with the ground or a pipe, with an option to restart.
